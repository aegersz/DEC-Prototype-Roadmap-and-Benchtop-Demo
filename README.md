DEC Prototype Roadmap and Benchtop Demo

---

Roadmap Overview

Step 1: DIY Benchtop Demonstrator (Cost: <$500)

Goal: Show it holds charge and powers something.

Build Scale: Very small cell (mAh to a few Ah).

Materials: Off-the-shelf glass/plastic lab cells or test jars, crystal + oil formulation, simple electrode plates (copper, graphite, or stainless steel), cheap separator (bentonite, cellulose, fiberglass mat).

Tools: Multimeter, cheap battery analyzer (~$50).

Demo: Light up an LEDI, run a fan, or charge a phone.


⚠️ Safety: Keep voltage/current low to avoid fire/explosion risk.


---

Step 2: Academic / Makerspace Partnership (Cost: free–$2k)

Goal: Get proper lab measurements for credibility.

Where: Uni electrochem labs, local makerspace with electronics focus.

What They Do: Charge/discharge cycling, measure energy density, efficiency, stability, independent verification.

How to Approach: Pitch as experimental battery concept, students may take it as a thesis/capstone.



---

Step 3: Small-Scale Prototype Build (Cost: $5k–$20k)

Goal: Make an industry-looking prototype.

Who: Small contract R&D shops, specialist prototyping outfits.

Output: Proper encapsulated cell, repeatable build process, measurable performance.



---

Step 4: Scale + Pitch

Goal: Prove viability to industry.

Pitch to EV/renewable startups, defence contracts, government innovation grants.

Combine working demo + lab data for credibility.

Assembly Instructions

1. Place bottom electrode in container.


2. Saturate separator layer with oil/crystal mixture and place on bottom electrode.


3. Place top electrode on separator.


4. Apply compression frame (acrylic/polycarbonate) to hold layers flat.


5. Connect Force (F+/F-) and Sense (S+/S-) leads for Kelvin measurements.


6. Connect LED or motor as demo load.


7. Charge carefully with bench PSU at low voltage/current (1.5–3V, low mA).


8. Measure / Observe voltage/current and demo load functionality.

Additional Notes:
- Use S+ / S- leads for Kelvin voltage measurement.
- Keep current low for safety.
- Add LED or small motor for visual demonstration.
